''' The value of determinant of a matrix can be calculated by following procedure â€“ 
For each element of first row or first column get cofactor of those elements and then multiply the element with the determinant of the corresponding cofactor, 
and finally add them with alternate signs. As a base case the value of determinant of a 1*1 matrix is the single value itself'''. 

Cofactor of an element, is a matrix which we can get by removing row and column of that element from that matrix.
