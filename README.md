## 100DaysOfAlgo
###  This repository will contain 100 days of Data structure and algorithms solved by me.
**Day 1**: 1) *Tower of Hanoi*   (Referrals[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/] )<br>
           2)  *N-Queens Problem* (Referrals[https://www.codesdope.com/blog/article/backtracking-explanation-and-n-queens-problem/])<br>
<br>

           
**Day 2**: 1) *Permutation of a given string*<br>
           2) *Permutation of a given string in lexicographical order*<br>
<br>


**Day 3**: 1) *Print all possible strings of length k that can be formed from a set of n characters*<br>
           2) *Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting time ranges and returns a list of condensed 
ranges.Meeting is represented as a list having tuples in form of (start time , end time)*<br>
<br>

**Day 4**: 1)*Given a list of numbers(maybe positives or negatives) find triplets that equals to a desired sum*
<br>
