## 100DaysOfAlgo
#### *I have taken this challenge from 31st August 2020 that i will daily solve Data Structures and Algorithm Problems for constantly 100 days.I will update my daily learning progress on Linkedin too in form of daily posts with attached screenshots of code for the problems being solved*<br>
#### Problem Statement are taken from many sources like Geeks for Geeks, Interview Cake, Leetcode etc.<br>
#### All codes/program files will have full problem statement, time and space complexity, Appoach to solve the problem, necessary comments for better understanding of code and steps

###  This repository will contain 100 days of Data structure and algorithms solved by me.
### Arrays(Recursion, Backtracking)
**Day 1**: 1) *Tower of Hanoi*   (Referrals[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/] )<br>
           2)  *N-Queens Problem* (Referrals[https://www.codesdope.com/blog/article/backtracking-explanation-and-n-queens-problem/])
<br>

**Day 2**: 1) *Permutation of a given string*<br>
           2) *Permutation of a given string in lexicographical order*
 <br>

**Day 3**: 1) *Print all possible strings of length k that can be formed from a set of n characters*<br>
           2) *Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting time ranges and returns a list of condensed ranges.Meeting is represented as a list having tuples in form of (start time , end time)*<br>

**Day 4**: 1) *Given a list of numbers(maybe positives or negatives) find triplets that equals to a desired sum* <br>
           2) *Given three lists of take out orders, dine in orders and served orders.You need to find whether the service is first come first served
            Problem Statement taken from : Interview Cake*
<br>

**Day 5**: 1) *Chain Matrix Multiplication([https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/360/dp-matrix-parens.html])Go through this link for better understanding of logic working behind the scenes<br>*
2) *Given an array of integers write a functon that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a^2 = b^2+c^2*
<br>

**Day 6**: 1) *Write a function that rotates an arr[] of size n by d elements in left direction*<br>
2) *Write a program to print all leaders in array.An element is leader if its greater than all the elements to its right side.And the rightmost element is always a leader*
<br>

**Day 7**: 1) *Write a program to check whether two numbers are co-prime or not* <br>
2) *Some basic sorting algorithms*
<br>

**Day 8**:  1)*Given a binary String with wildcard characters('?') at some places.Print all the possible binary strings combinations formed by replacing wildcard characters with 0 or 1*<br>
2)*Print all the possible solutions of N Queens Problems*
<br>

**Day 9**:  1)*Python program to generate all binary strings with equal sums in left and right halves.*<br>
2)*Program to print all combination of size r in an array of size n*
<br>

**Day 10**: 1)*Power set in lexicographical order*<br>
2)*Taken from codechef([https://www.codechef.com/problems/LECANDY])*
<br>

**Day 11**: 1)*Count substrings that start and end with same letter*<br>
2)*Count consonants in a string**
<br>

**Day 12**:  1)*Solved chef and notebooks from codechef([https://www.codechef.com/problems/CNOTE])*<br>
2)*Swap Nodes in pairs([https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs])*
<br>

**Day 13**:  1)*Quadruplets with a given sum*<br>
2)*Minimum number possible after k swaps*
<br>

**Day 14**:  1)*Kadane's algorithtm*<br>
2)*Given two sorted arrays X[] and Y[] of size m and n where m>=n and X[] has exactly n vacant positions, merge elements of Y[] in their correct position in array X[] i.e.merge
X[] and Y[] by maintaining the sorted order
<br>

### Linked List
**Day 15**: 1)*Linked list insertion*<br>
2)*Counting number of nodes in a Linked list iteratively*
<br>

**Day 16**1)*Deleting nodes in a linked list*<br>
2)*To get the Nth node in a Linked list*
<br>

**Day 17**1)*Counting number of times a particular node occurs in a singly linked list*<br>
2)*Write a program to get the Nth node from last in a singly linked list*<br>
3)*Function to reverse a singly linked list*
<br>

**Day 18**1)*Reverse Specified Portion of a Linked list*<br>
2)*Write a program to find the middle element of linked list*
<br>

**Day 19**1)*Given a singly linked list, whose nodes represent digits of a number, add a single digit number to it.*<br>
2)*Remove duplicates from singly linked sorted list*
<br>

**Day 20**1)*Given a singly linked list, check whether the linked list is palindrome or not*<br>
2)*Added a new file named "Algorithms", added some basics like sorting algorithms in it
<br>

**Day 21**1)*Doubly linked list -all methods of insertion*
<br>

**Day 22**1)*Insertion sort in a singly linked list*<br>
2)* Add two linked list without using any extra space*
<br>

**Day 23**1)*Removing redundant nodes in a linked list*
