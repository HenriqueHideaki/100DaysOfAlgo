## 100DaysOfAlgo
#### *I have taken this challenge from 31st August 2020 that i will daily solve Data Structures and Algorithm Problems for constantly 100 days.I will update my daily learning progress on Linkedin too in form of daily posts with attached screenshots of code for the problems being solved*<br>
#### Problem Statement are taken from many sources like Geeks for Geeks, Interview Cake, Leetcode etc.<br>
#### All codes/program files will have full problem statement, time and space complexity, Appoach to solve the problem, necessary comments for better understanding of code and steps

###  This repository will contain 100 days of Data structure and algorithms solved by me.
**Day 1**: 1) *Tower of Hanoi*   (Referrals[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-tower-of-hanoi/] )<br>
           2)  *N-Queens Problem* (Referrals[https://www.codesdope.com/blog/article/backtracking-explanation-and-n-queens-problem/])<br>
<br>

           
**Day 2**: 1) *Permutation of a given string*<br>
           2) *Permutation of a given string in lexicographical order*<br>
<br>


**Day 3**: 1) *Print all possible strings of length k that can be formed from a set of n characters*<br>
           2) *Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting time ranges and returns a list of condensed 
ranges.Meeting is represented as a list having tuples in form of (start time , end time)*<br>
<br>


**Day 4**: 1)*Given a list of numbers(maybe positives or negatives) find triplets that equals to a desired sum*
<br>
           2)*Given three lists of take out orders, dine in orders and served orders.You need to find whether the service is first come first served
            Problem Statement taken from : Interview Cake*


<br>
**Day 5** 1)* Chain Matrix Multiplication(https://www.radford.edu/~nokie/classes/360/dp-matrix-parens.html)Go through this link for better understanding of logic working behind the scenes<br>
2)*Given an array of integers write a functon that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a^2 = b^2+c^2
