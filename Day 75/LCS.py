''' Problem statement : Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the
subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order


Algorithm: 

Create an empty hash.
Insert all array elements to hash.
Do following for every element arr[i]
Check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence. To check this, simply look for arr[i] â€“ 1 in the hash, if not found, then this is the first element a subsequence.
If this element is the first element, then count the number of elements in the consecutive starting with this element. Iterate from arr[i] + 1 till the last element that can be found.
If the count is more than the previous longest subsequence found, then update this.

Time complexity : O(n)
Space complexity : O(n)

	for ele in arr:
		s.add(ele)

	# check each possible sequence from the start
	# then update optimal length

		# if current element is the starting
		# element of a sequence

			# update optimal length if this length
			# is more
			ans = max(ans, j-arr[i])
