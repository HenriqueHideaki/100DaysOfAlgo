#  The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack
#  each other.

A utility function to check if a queen can be placed on board[row][col]. Note that this function is called when "col" queens are 
already placed in columns from 0 to col -1.So we need to check only left side for attacking queens '''
